        logline: "When badges tear families apart, can communities build a shield strong enough to heal? A Few Mad Apples traces the unbroken line from slave patrols to bodycams, revealing the impact of mass incarceration on Black families through the eyes of children navigating loss, resilience, and hope.",
        synopsis: ["Across the United States, nearly 5 million children have experienced the incarceration of a parent. For Black children, the odds are devastatingly higher: they are nearly five times more likely than white children to lose a mother or father to the system. A Few Mad Apples dismantles the comforting myth that family separation is the work of “a few bad apples.” Instead, it reveals an unbroken line from slave patrols to modern policing—a system designed to fracture Black families and criminalize Black parenthood.",
            "Set in Jacksonville, Florida—a city where the legacy of slave patrols still shapes today’s policing—the film follows the lives of Black children navigating the fallout of mass incarceration.  Here, children learn to fear badges, not for what they protect, but for what they take away. Parents are jailed for poverty, for minor infractions, for simply being Black in America. These stories are not outliers; they are the rule in a nation where the criminal justice system has replaced the auction block with the courtroom, and separation papers echo the ledgers of slavery."

        logline: "A filmmaker stuck as the token Black hire at a fake woke Brooklyn startup fights back with her camera, turning office chaos into a hit documentary with backup from her loud, loving, polyamorous crew.",
        synopsis: ["Snackly Tech is the kind of startup where the CEO posts motivational quotes about “disrupting inequality” while the office printer literally catches fire every Tuesday. Shantasia takes the job because her camera dreams need funding and Brooklyn rent is basically financial terrorism. What she doesn’t expect is being promoted to “Chief Vibes Officer,” mostly so she can explain to her team that just because Justin Bieber said “it’s not clocking to you that I’m standing on business,” doesn’t mean it belongs in the onboarding manual.",
            "Her survival kit includes her soul tribe: Shondarosa, her long-distance girlfriend who turns every phone call into a TED Talk about boundaries; Keke, her asexual musician partner who responds to workplace drama with perfectly curated playlists and deadpan memes; and Javonte, her gospel-trained best friend who can bless you and read you for filth in the same sentence.",
            "When Snackly gets bought by an even more ridiculous company called Slimeo, Shantasia stops pretending to be grateful and starts filming. Her documentary becomes the internet’s new obsession, and suddenly everyone wants to know how she survived the corporate comedy show."],
